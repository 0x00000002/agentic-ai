# Conversation Management

## Overview

The conversation management system in Agentic-AI handles:

- Maintaining conversation history
- Formatting messages for different providers
- Extracting "thoughts" and other metadata from responses
- Managing context and tool calls

## ConversationManager

The `ConversationManager` class tracks the conversation state:

```python
from src.conversation.conversation_manager import ConversationManager

# Create a conversation manager
conversation = ConversationManager()

# Add messages
conversation.add_message(role="user", content="Hello, how are you?")
conversation.add_message(role="assistant", content="I'm doing well! How can I help you today?")

# Get all messages
messages = conversation.get_messages()

# Get the latest message
last_message = conversation.get_last_message()

# Clear the conversation
conversation.clear()
```

## Working with Thoughts

The system can extract AI "thoughts" (typically enclosed in `<thinking>` tags) from responses to aid in debugging the AI's reasoning process. This extraction happens when adding a message if the `extract_thoughts` flag is set.

```python
# Assume 'conversation' is an initialized ConversationManager instance
raw_response_content = "<thinking>Let me consider the best approach here...</thinking>The answer is 42."

# Add the assistant message, enabling thought extraction
conversation.add_message(
    role="assistant",
    content=raw_response_content,
    extract_thoughts=True
)

# Get the last message added
last_message = conversation.get_last_message()

# The 'content' key contains the response without the thinking tags
print(f"Processed Content: {last_message['content']}")
# Output: Processed Content: The answer is 42.

# The extracted thoughts are stored in the 'thoughts' key within the message dictionary
if 'thoughts' in last_message:
    print(f"Extracted Thoughts: {last_message['thoughts']}")
    # Output: Extracted Thoughts: Let me consider the best approach here...
# Note: If multiple thinking blocks exist, they might be concatenated or handled based on ResponseParser logic.

# There is no separate get_thoughts() method on ConversationManager itself.
# Thoughts are accessed directly from the message dictionary after extraction.
```

## Handling Tool Calls

Conversation manager also tracks tool calls and their results:

```python
# Add a message with tool calls
conversation.add_message(
    role="assistant",
    content="I'll check the weather for you.",
    tool_calls=[
        {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "arguments": {"location": "New York"}
        }
    ]
)

# Add the tool response
conversation.add_message(
    role="tool",
    name="get_weather",
    content="It's sunny and 75Â°F in New York."
)
```

## Response Parser

The `ResponseParser` processes raw AI responses:

```python
from src.conversation.response_parser import ResponseParser

parser = ResponseParser()

# Parse a response with thoughts
result = parser.parse_response(
    "<thinking>I should search for this information.</thinking>The capital of France is Paris.",
    extract_thoughts=True,
    show_thinking=False  # Hide thoughts in final output
)

# Result: {
#   "content": "The capital of France is Paris.",
#   "thoughts": "I should search for this information."
# }
```
