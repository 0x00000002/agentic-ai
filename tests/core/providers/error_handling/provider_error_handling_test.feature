Feature: Provider Error Handling
  As a developer using the agentic-ai framework
  I want to ensure robust error handling for provider operations
  So that the system can gracefully handle various failure scenarios

  Background:
    Given the AI framework is initialized
    And provider configurations are available
    And a provider instance is created

  Scenario: Handle rate limiting
    Given a provider with rate limiting
    When I make multiple rapid requests
    Then the provider should handle rate limits gracefully
    And appropriate backoff should be applied
    And requests should be retried after backoff
    And the system should log rate limit events

  Scenario: Handle network errors
    Given a provider with network connectivity issues
    When I make a request
    Then the provider should detect network errors
    And appropriate retry logic should be applied
    And the error should be properly propagated
    And the system should log network errors

  Scenario: Handle invalid responses
    Given a provider that returns malformed responses
    When I make a request
    Then the provider should validate the response
    And invalid responses should be rejected
    And appropriate error messages should be generated
    And the system should log validation failures

  Scenario: Handle concurrent request limits
    Given a provider with concurrent request limits
    When I make multiple concurrent requests
    Then the provider should manage request queues
    And respect concurrent request limits
    And handle queue overflow gracefully
    And the system should log queue management events

  Scenario: Implement retry mechanisms
    Given a provider with transient failures
    When I make a request that fails
    Then the provider should implement retry logic
    And retries should follow exponential backoff
    And retry limits should be respected
    And the system should log retry attempts

  Scenario: Handle authentication errors
    Given a provider with invalid credentials
    When I make a request
    Then the provider should detect authentication failures
    And appropriate error messages should be generated
    And the system should log authentication errors
    And sensitive information should not be logged

  Scenario: Handle timeout errors
    Given a provider with slow responses
    When I make a request with a timeout
    Then the provider should respect timeout settings
    And timeout errors should be properly handled
    And the system should log timeout events
    And appropriate error messages should be generated

  Scenario: Handle provider-specific errors
    Given a provider with unique error conditions
    When I encounter a provider-specific error
    Then the error should be properly categorized
    And appropriate error handling should be applied
    And the error should be properly propagated
    And the system should log provider-specific errors
